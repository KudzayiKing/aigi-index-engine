# AIGI Index Engine – Layer 1

This is the open-source engine that computes the **Composite Intelligence Score (CIS)** for the AIGI protocol. It aggregates public AI benchmarks, adoption metrics, and momentum to produce a single index of AI progress.

## Principles

- **Deterministic** – Same inputs always produce same outputs.
- **Reproducible** – Anyone can run the Docker container and verify results.
